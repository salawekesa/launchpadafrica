  IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE UPLOADING TO HOSTINGER
================================================================================

Your deployment package is ready! But you need to do ONE THING FIRST:

================================================================================
STEP 1: CREATE .env FILE (REQUIRED!)
================================================================================

Create a file named ".env" (yes, it starts with a dot) in THIS folder
(deploy-package folder) with the following content:

------- Copy everything below this line -------

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

------- Copy everything above this line -------

REPLACE:
- your_database_name = The database name you create in Hostinger cPanel
- your_database_user = The database user you create in Hostinger cPanel
- your_database_password = The password you set for that user

HOW TO GET THESE VALUES:
1. Log into Hostinger cPanel
2. Go to "PostgreSQL Databases"
3. Create a database (e.g., username_lift)
4. Create a user with a password
5. Add the user to the database with ALL PRIVILEGES
6. Use those values in your .env file

================================================================================
STEP 2: CREATE THE ZIP FILE
================================================================================

1. Select ALL files in this deploy-package folder INCLUDING:
   - .env (that you just created)
   - package.json
   - package-lock.json
   - server.js
   - dist folder
   - src folder

2. Right-click → "Send to" → "Compressed (zipped) folder"
   OR use 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.

3. Name it something like "app-deploy.zip"

IMPORTANT: Make sure the .env file is INSIDE the ZIP!

================================================================================
STEP 3: UPLOAD TO HOSTINGER
================================================================================

Follow the guide in:
- Quick guide: QUICK_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md (in parent folder)
- Full guide: HOSTINGER_CPANEL_GUIDE.md (in parent folder)

Quick summary:
1. Create PostgreSQL database in Hostinger cPanel
2. Setup Node.js App in cPanel (Software section)
3. Upload this ZIP to your application folder
4. Extract the ZIP
5. Run NPM Install in Setup Node.js App
6. Restart the application
7. Initialize database with: npm run init-db

================================================================================
NEED HELP?
================================================================================

See the detailed guides:
- QUICK_DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md (20-minute guide)
- HOSTINGER_CPANEL_GUIDE.md (comprehensive guide)

Both are in the parent folder (plp-spark-launch)

================================================================================
CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before uploading, make sure:
[ ] .env file created with YOUR database credentials
[ ] .env file is included in the ZIP
[ ] All files listed above are in the ZIP
[ ] PostgreSQL database created in Hostinger cPanel
[ ] Node.js App configured in Hostinger cPanel

================================================================================

Good luck with your deployment! 🚀
